## The History of the Internet

[Who made HTML?](HTML.md)




## Who Made CSS and Why?
- **Inventor**: Håkon Wium Lie
- **Year**: 1994
- **Why**: Håkon Wium Lie developed CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to separate the presentation (layout, colors, fonts) from the structure of a document, which is defined by HTML. Before CSS, web styling was embedded directly into HTML, which made web pages harder to maintain and less flexible. CSS allows for a consistent and efficient way to style multiple pages.

## JavaScript (Early and Later)
- **Inventor**: Brendan Eich
- **Year**: 1995 (early)
- **Early JavaScript**: Initially created in just 10 days at Netscape, JavaScript was designed to bring interactivity to websites. It allowed basic form validation and simple animations. Early JavaScript was a client-side language (run in the browser).
- **Later JavaScript**: Over time, JavaScript evolved into a much more robust and versatile language. Modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) supports object-oriented programming, asynchronous operations (such as fetching data from servers), and works both client-side and server-side (Node.js). It's one of the core technologies of the web alongside HTML and CSS.

## Circuit Switching vs. Packet Switching
### Circuit Switching:
- Used in traditional telephone networks.
- A dedicated communication path is established between two nodes for the duration of the connection (like a phone call).
- All data follows the same path.
- Less efficient for data transmission, as the dedicated line is reserved even when no data is being transmitted.

### Packet Switching:
- Used in the Internet and most modern data networks.
- Data is broken into small packets and sent independently over the network.
- Each packet can take a different path and is reassembled at the destination.
- More efficient for transmitting data, as the network can handle multiple communications simultaneously, and resources are used more dynamically.

## Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn
- **Contributions**: Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn are considered two of the "fathers of the Internet."
  - **Vint Cerf**: Co-designer of the TCP/IP protocol suite, which is the foundation of data transmission on the Internet.
  - **Bob Kahn**: Worked alongside Cerf to develop the concept of the packet-switched network and the Internet’s architecture.
  - Their work laid the groundwork for how computers communicate over the Internet by developing a reliable and scalable method of packet switching.

## PHP and Perl in the Context of the Internet
### PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor):
- **Inventor**: Rasmus Lerdorf
- **Year**: 1995
- **Why**: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development. It allows developers to build dynamic websites that interact with databases and process user input. PHP is widely used for backend development, and platforms like WordPress are built on it.
- **Popular Use**: Building web applications, forms, content management systems (CMS), etc.

### Perl:
- **Inventor**: Larry Wall
- **Year**: 1987
- **Why**: Perl was originally developed for text manipulation but quickly became a popular choice for web development, system administration, and automation tasks. It was one of the earliest languages used for CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts, which enabled web servers to execute programs in response to web requests.
- **Popular Use**: Used for a wide variety of tasks, including web scraping, text processing, and more. While less common today in web development, it still has a strong community for scripting and automation.

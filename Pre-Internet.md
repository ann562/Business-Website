## J.C.R. Licklider
-**History**:
J.C.R. Licklider, born in 1915, was a pioneering figure in computer science and psychology whose work laid the foundations for the Internet. In the early 1960s, he served as the first director of the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office, where he championed the idea of a connected network of computers that could facilitate communication and information sharing. Licklider's vision of a "Galactic Network" inspired the development of ARPANET, the first operational packet-switching network, which became the precursor to the modern Internet. His advocacy for time-sharing and interactive computing transformed how computers were used, allowing multiple users to access and interact with a computer simultaneously. Licklider's contributions significantly shaped the landscape of computing, and he is remembered as one of the key architects of the digital age.

- **Who**: Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider
- **Why**: He envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers where everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site.
- **When**: Early 1960s
- **Contribution**: His ideas influenced the development of ARPANET and the conceptual foundation of the internet.

## Nuclear Weapons (Impact on Internet Development)
-**History**:
The history of nuclear weapons has had a profound effect on the development of computer networks, particularly during the Cold War. The threat of nuclear conflict highlighted the need for secure and reliable communication systems that could operate even in the face of disaster. In the 1960s, the U.S. Department of Defense initiated research projects to create a decentralized network capable of maintaining communication during a nuclear attack. This led to the creation of ARPANET in 1969, the first operational packet-switching network. ARPANET's design prioritized redundancy and resilience, allowing information to be rerouted through various pathways if certain nodes were compromised. The lessons learned from military needs regarding communication during crises ultimately influenced the technologies and protocols that evolved into the modern Internet, demonstrating how geopolitical tensions can drive technological innovation.

- **Who**: U.S. Military
- **Why**: The Cold War prompted the need for a decentralized communication system that could survive nuclear attacks.
- **When**: Post-WWII, during the Cold War (1940s-1950s)
- **Impact**: This led to the concept of a distributed network (the foundation for ARPANET) to ensure communication could continue in case of a nuclear strike.

## ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency, later DARPA)
-**History**:
The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was established in 1958 by the United States government in response to the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union. Its primary mission was to advance U.S. technological capabilities and ensure national security through innovative research and development. ARPA was instrumental in the early days of computer science and networking, most notably funding the development of ARPANET, the first packet-switching network, which eventually evolved into the modern Internet.

In 1972, ARPA was restructured and renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to emphasize its focus on defense-related projects. Over the years, DARPA has continued to drive groundbreaking research, fostering developments in areas 

- **Who**: Established by the U.S. Department of Defense
- **Why**: ARPA was created in response to the Soviet Union launching Sputnik; the U.S. wanted to accelerate technological research.
- **When**: Founded in 1958
- **Contribution**: ARPA initiated research that eventually led to the development of ARPANET, the precursor to the internet.

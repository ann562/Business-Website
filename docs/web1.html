      <h1>History of the Internet and Web Technologies</h1>

      <h2>HTML/HTTP Protocol (Tim Berners-Lee)</h2>
      <p><strong>History</strong>:<br>
      Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, invented the World Wide Web in the late 1980s while working at CERN. In 1989, he proposed a system to facilitate information sharing among researchers, leading to the development of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). HTML enabled the creation and formatting of web documents, while HTTP provided the framework for transmitting those documents over the Internet.</p>
      <p>In 1991, Berners-Lee published the first website and made the web accessible to the public. His contributions laid the foundation for the modern Internet, and today, he continues to advocate for an open web focused on standards and privacy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Who</strong>: Tim Berners-Lee</li>
        <li><strong>Why</strong>: To create a system for sharing and connecting documents across the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>When</strong>: Developed in 1989-1990</li>
        <li><strong>Contribution</strong>: Invented HTML and HTTP, enabling the first web browsers and servers to communicate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p><strong>History</strong>:<br>
      JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications. Initially named Mocha, it was later renamed to JavaScript to align with the popularity of Java. JavaScript was introduced to add interactivity to static web pages. After Microsoft developed JScript for Internet Explorer, JavaScript was standardized as ECMAScript by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) in 1997.</p>
      <p>Over time, JavaScript evolved with major updates like ES5 (2009) and ES6 (2015), becoming essential for web development. Today, it powers dynamic content and interactive applications on both the client and server side through environments like Node.js.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Who</strong>: Brendan Eich (Netscape Communications)</li>
        <li><strong>Why</strong>: To add interactivity to static web pages.</li>
        <li><strong>When</strong>: Created in 1995</li>
        <li><strong>Contribution</strong>: Became the standard for client-side programming on websites.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
      <p><strong>History</strong>:<br>
      CSS was proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994 to separate content from presentation in web design. The first official CSS1 specification was published in 1996, enabling basic styling for fonts, colors, and layouts. CSS2, released in 1998, introduced new features like absolute positioning and media types. CSS3, launched in 2011, added features such as animations and responsive design.</p>
      <p>Today, CSS is a fundamental tool for web design, helping developers create visually appealing and responsive websites.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Who</strong>: Håkon Wium Lie</li>
        <li><strong>Why</strong>: To separate content from design and provide more control over the presentation of web pages.</li>
        <li><strong>When</strong>: Proposed in 1994</li>
        <li><strong>Contribution</strong>: Essential for styling and layout of web pages.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Perl & PHP (Server-Side Languages)</h2>
      <p><strong>History</strong>:<br>
      Perl, created by Larry Wall in 1987, was initially developed for text processing and system administration. It became popular for CGI programming in the early days of the web. PHP, developed by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1995, started as a set of tools for web development and evolved into a powerful language with the release of PHP 3 in 1998.</p>
      <p>Perl and PHP played crucial roles in early web development, with Perl excelling at text manipulation and automation, while PHP became widely used for building dynamic websites and content management systems.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Who</strong>: Perl (Larry Wall), PHP (Rasmus Lerdorf)</li>
        <li><strong>Why</strong>: To enable server-side scripting for dynamic web content.</li>
        <li><strong>When</strong>: Perl (1987), PHP (1995)</li>
        <li><strong>Contribution</strong>: Key role in developing early web applications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Linus Torvalds (Linux)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Who</strong>: Linus Torvalds</li>
        <li><strong>Why</strong>: To create a free and open-source operating system.</li>
        <li><strong>When</strong>: Released the first version of Linux in 1991</li>
        <li><strong>Contribution</strong>: Linux became the foundation for many web servers and internet infrastructure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Early Search Engines (Altavista and HotBot)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Who</strong>: Altavista (Digital Equipment Corporation), HotBot (Wired Magazine)</li>
        <li><strong>Why</strong>: To make searching the growing web easier.</li>
        <li><strong>When</strong>: Altavista (1995), HotBot (1996)</li>
        <li><strong>Contribution</strong>: Among the first search engines, helping users navigate the early web.</li>
      </ul>

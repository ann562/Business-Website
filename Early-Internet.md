## ARPANET
- **Who**: Developed by ARPA (specifically, engineers like Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf)
- **Why**: To create a network that would allow multiple computers to communicate across long distances, enabling resource sharing and enhancing communication.
- **When**: 1969 (First ARPANET message sent)
- **Contribution**: ARPANET was the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol, foundational for the modern internet.

## Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn
- **Who**: Vint Cerf (often called the "Father of the Internet") and Bob Kahn
- **Why**: To solve the problem of how different networks could communicate with each other seamlessly.
- **When**: Early 1970s
- **Contribution**: Developed the TCP/IP protocol, which became the standard for internet communication.

## Gopher
- **Who**: Created by Mark McCahill and his team at the University of Minnesota.
- **Why**: To organize and retrieve documents on early networks (including ARPANET) in a hierarchical structure.

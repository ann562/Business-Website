## HTML/HTTP Protocol (Tim Berners-Lee)
-**History**:
Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, is best known for inventing the World Wide Web in the late 1980s while working at CERN. In 1989, he proposed a system to facilitate information sharing among researchers, which led to the development of key technologies: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). HTML allowed users to create and format documents for the web, while HTTP provided the framework for transmitting those documents over the Internet.

In 1991, Berners-Lee published the first website and made the web accessible to the public. His vision was to create a decentralized platform for information sharing, promoting an open and user-driven Internet. The introduction of HTML and HTTP revolutionized how information is shared and consumed, enabling the creation of countless websites and applications. Berners-Lee's contributions to web standards and protocols laid the foundation for the modern Internet, making him a pivotal figure in the digital age. Today, he continues to advocate for an open web, emphasizing the importance of web standards and privacy.

- **Who**: Tim Berners-Lee
- **Why**: To create a system for sharing and connecting documents across the internet.
- **When**: Developed in 1989-1990
- **Contribution**: Invented HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), allowing the first web browsers and servers to communicate.

## JavaScript
-**History**:
JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications Corporation, originally named Mocha, and later renamed to JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java. First introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0, the language aimed to enable interactive web pages and enhance user experience. The need for standardization arose when Microsoft developed JScript for Internet Explorer, leading to the formation of the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), which standardized JavaScript as ECMAScript in 1997. Over the years, JavaScript has undergone significant evolution, with major updates like ECMAScript 5 in 2009 and ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015 introducing new features and syntax improvements. Today, JavaScript is a cornerstone of web development, enabling dynamic content and interactive applications, and has expanded its reach to server-side programming through environments like Node.js.

- **Who**: Brendan Eich (Netscape Communications)
- **Why**: To add interactivity to static web pages.
- **When**: Created in 1995
- **Contribution**: JavaScript became the standard for client-side programming on websites.
## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
-**History**:
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994 while he was working with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The primary goal of CSS was to separate content from presentation, allowing web developers to define styles for web pages in a consistent and efficient manner. The first official specification, CSS1, was published by W3C in 1996, providing basic styling capabilities for fonts, colors, and layouts. CSS2 followed in 1998, introducing features like absolute positioning and media types. In 2011, CSS3 was introduced as a modularized version, allowing for incremental updates and the addition of new features such as transitions, animations, and responsive design elements. Today, CSS has become an essential technology for web design, enabling the creation of visually appealing and responsive websites that enhance user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Who**: Håkon Wium Lie
- **Why**: To separate content from design and allow more control over the visual presentation of web pages.
- **When**: Proposed in 1994
- **Contribution**: CSS is used to style and layout web pages, making them visually appealing.

## Perl & PHP (Server-Side Languages)
-**History**:
Perl was created by Larry Wall in 1987 as a versatile scripting language for text processing, originally intended for report generation and system administration tasks. Its flexibility and powerful text manipulation capabilities quickly made it popular among developers, especially for CGI (Common Gateway Interface) programming in the early days of the web. In contrast, PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) was developed by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 as a set of tools for web development, enabling dynamic content generation. Originally called "Personal Home Page Tools," PHP evolved into a full-fledged programming language with the release of PHP 3 in 1998, which introduced support for databases and improved performance. Both Perl and PHP played crucial roles in server-side scripting, with Perl being favored for complex text processing and automation tasks, while PHP became a dominant language for web development due to its ease of use and integration with HTML. Today, both languages continue to be used in various applications, although PHP is particularly prominent in building dynamic websites and content management systems.

- **Who**: Perl (Larry Wall), PHP (Rasmus Lerdorf)
- **Why**: To enable server-side scripting for dynamic web content.
- **When**: Perl (1987), PHP (1995)
- **Contribution**: Both languages played a key role in developing early web applications.

## Linus Torvalds (Linux)
- **Who**: Linus Torvalds
- **Why**: To create a free and open-source operating system.
- **When**: Released the first version of Linux in 1991
- **Contribution**: Linux became the foundation for many web servers and is a key part of internet infrastructure.

## Early Search Engines (Altavista and HotBot)
- **Who**: Altavista (Digital Equipment Corporation), HotBot (Wired magazine)
- **Why**: To make searching the growing web easier.
- **When**: Altavista (1995), HotBot (1996)
- **Contribution**: These were among the first web search engines, helping users navigate the early web.

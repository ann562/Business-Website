    <h1>History</h1>
    <p> Google's PageRank, developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998, introduced a revolutionary algorithm that ranked web pages based on the quality and quantity of links pointing to them, transforming search engines and establishing Google's dominance in the field. In 2000, Roy Fielding's doctoral dissertation formalized the REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture, which became the backbone of modern web APIs by enabling stateless communication over the web. Python, a programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, emphasized simplicity and readability, becoming essential in fields like web development, data analysis, and AI. Linus Torvalds, known for creating Linux, released Git in 2005 to enhance version control, with Git becoming the world's leading tool for collaborative software development.

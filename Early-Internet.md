## ARPANET
-**ARPANET History**:
ARPANET, created by the U.S. Department of Defense's ARPA, was the first packet-switching network, launched in 1969. It began with four nodes connecting universities and aimed to facilitate communication among researchers. The network introduced key concepts like packet switching and TCP/IP, which are fundamental to the Internet today. ARPANET was officially decommissioned in 1990, but its innovations laid the groundwork for modern networking.


- **Who**: Developed by ARPA (specifically, engineers like Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf)
- **Why**: To create a network that would allow multiple computers to communicate across long distances, enabling resource sharing and enhancing communication.
- **When**: 1969 (First ARPANET message sent)
- **Contribution**: ARPANET was the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol, foundational for the modern internet.

## Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn
-**History**:
Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn are renowned computer scientists known as the "fathers of the Internet" for their pioneering work in developing the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), which are foundational technologies for Internet communication. In the 1970s, they collaborated on a project to create a robust and scalable networking system, resulting in the publication of their seminal paper, "A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication," in 1974. This work laid the groundwork for modern Internet architecture, enabling diverse networks to interconnect and communicate. Their contributions have been instrumental in shaping the digital landscape we know today, earning them numerous awards, including the Turing Award and the National Medal of Technology.

- **Who**: Vint Cerf (often called the "Father of the Internet") and Bob Kahn
- **Why**: To solve the problem of how different networks could communicate with each other seamlessly.
- **When**: Early 1970s
- **Contribution**: Developed the TCP/IP protocol, which became the standard for internet communication.

## Gopher
-**History**:
Gopher is a distributed document-sharing system developed at the University of Minnesota in the early 1990s. It was designed to enable users to locate and retrieve documents from various servers in a structured, hierarchical manner. Gopher provides a menu-driven interface that allows users to navigate through directories of information, making it easier to find specific content. Although Gopher gained popularity as a precursor to the World Wide Web, its usage declined in the mid-1990s with the rise of the more versatile and visually rich web browsers. Despite this, Gopher laid the groundwork for future information retrieval systems and is still remembered for its simplicity and efficiency in organizing digital content.

- **Who**: Created by Mark McCahill and his team at the University of Minnesota.
- **Why**: To organize and retrieve documents on early networks (including ARPANET) in a hierarchical structure.
- **When**: Introduced in 1991
- **Contribution**: Gopher was one of the first widely used protocols for browsing the early internet, predating the World Wide Web.
